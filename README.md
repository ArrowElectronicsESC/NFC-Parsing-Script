NFC Cockpit Parsing script


We would like to share a way and script to create custom logs form the NFC Cockpit GUI, could be of use if timing is needing for detecting reading distances.

Just copy all the information from the log window and create a random file to then filter out with a custom script.

Hoping it to be of use.
